                                        A bland horror story that doesn't stick with readers is probably the worst fear
                                        for
                                        a horror writer. When we write a horror book, we strive to give the audience
                                        something they can never forget, and a good horror story always lingers on for a
                                        few
                                        days in a reader's mind.
